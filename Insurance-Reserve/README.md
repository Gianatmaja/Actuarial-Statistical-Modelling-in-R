# Estimating the Required Reserve for an Insurance Company Using Bayesian Statistics

### Problem Statement
An insurance company wishes to estimate the required reserve for the upcoming year, using the total aggregated claims for the previous 4 years. To do this, 
we will perform a Bayesian analysis to predict the necessary capital the company should hold such that we are 95% certain that the claims will not exceed 
this amount of reserve. We were told that the amount of the aggregated claim follows a given Rayleigh distribution with unknown parameter Î¸, and that the 
previous 4 total annual claims were 1.1, 0.7, 0.45, and 1.3 million GBP.
