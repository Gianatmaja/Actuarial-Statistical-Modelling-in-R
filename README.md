# Statistical Modelling in R

This repository contains several projects related to actuarial science & statistics, with codes in R.

### Optimising a Phone Manufacturer's Warranty Scheme Using Simulations & Markov Chains
A phone manufacturer, Apricot, has 3 class of products, low, medium, and high class phones, and is planning to offer lifetime warranties for its customers. For each class of phone, a replacement will be issued when a phone experiences a fault and can't be repaired on the same day. Further, a replacement will also be given if a phone reaches a certain number of faults (2 for low class, and 3 for middle & high class). Given the probabilities and costs associated to faults, same-day repairs, and replacements, how can the phone company optimise its warranty scheme to minimise costs?

### Bayesian Analysis of Super Discounts
A retailer, wishes to estimate the effects of super discounts, which occur on around 40% of the time, on their earnings. Given a sample of 100 data points, showing the daily sales (assumed to be normally distributed) for 100 days (with and without super discount), we will perform a Baysesian analysis to find out if super discounts increase sales.
