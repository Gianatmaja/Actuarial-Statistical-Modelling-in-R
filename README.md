### Optimising a Phone Manufacturer's Warranty Scheme Using Simulations & Markov Chains
A phone manufacturer, Apricot, has 3 class of products, low, medium, and high class phones, and is planning to offer lifetime warranties for its customers. For each class of phone, a replacement will be issued when a phone experiences a fault and can't be repaired on the same day. Further, a replacement will also be given if a phone reaches a certain number of faults (2 for low class, and 3 for middle & high class). Given the probabilities and costs associated to faults, same-day repairs, and replacements, how can the phone company optimise its warranty scheme to minimise costs?
